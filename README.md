# loopback-example-access-control

```
$ git clone https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-example-access-control
$ cd loopback-example-access-control
$ npm install
$ node .
```

In this example, we create "Startkicker" (a basic Kickstarter-like
application) to demonstrate authentication and authorization mechanisms in
LoopBack. The application consists of four types of users:

 - `guest`
 - `owner`
 - `team member`
 - `administrator`

Each user type has permission to perform tasks based on their role and the
application's ACL (access control list) entries.

## MySQL

This example has been modified for MySQL storage purpose.
It creates database structure in local mysql server and loads test data after the node run command (node .)

You need to create MySQL database first with the settings written in server/datasources.json

## Procedure

### Create the application

#### Application information

- Name: `loopback-example-access-control`
- Directory to contain the project: `loopback-example-access-control`

```
$ lb app loopback-example-access-control
... # follow the prompts
$ cd loopback-example-access-control
```

### Add the models

#### Model information
- Name: `appuser`
  - Datasource: `db`
  - Base class: `User`
  - Expose via REST: `No`
  - Custom plural form: *Leave blank*
  - Properties
    - *None*
- Name: `team`
  - Datasource: `db`
  - Base class: `PersistedModel`
  - Expose via REST: `No`
  - Custom plural form: *Leave blank*
  - Properties
    - `ownerId`
      - Number
      - Not required
    - `memberId`
      - Number
      - Required
- Name: `project`
  - Datasource: `db`
  - Base class: `PersistedModel`
  - Expose via REST: `Yes`
  - Custom plural form: *Leave blank*
  - Properties
    - `name`
      - String
      - Not required
    - `balance`
      - Number
      - Not required

> No properties are required for the `user` model because we inherit them from
> the built-in `User` model by specifying it as the base class.

```
$ lb model user
... # follow the prompts, repeat for `team` and `project`
```

### Define the remote methods

Define three remote methods in [`project.js`](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-example-access-control/blob/master/common/models/project.js):

- [`listProjects`](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-example-access-control/blob/master/common/models/project.js#L2-L13)
- [`donate`](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-example-access-control/blob/master/common/models/project.js#L15-L31)
- [`withdraw`](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-example-access-control/blob/master/common/models/project.js#L33-54)

### Create the model relations

#### Model relation information

- `user`
  - has many
    - `project`
      - Property name for the relation: `projects`
      - Custom foreign key: `ownerId`
      - Require a through model: No
    - `team`
      - Property name for the relation: `teams`
      - Custom foreign key: `ownerId`
      - Require a through model: No
- `team`
  - has many
    - `user`
      - Property name for the relation: `members`
      - Custom foreign key: `memberId`
      - Require a through model: No
- `project`
  - belongs to
    - `user`
      - Property name for the relation: `user`
      - Custom foreign key: `ownerId`

### Add model instances

Create a boot script named [`sample-models.js`](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-example-access-control/blob/master/server/boot/sample-models.js).

This script does the following:

- [Creates 3 users](/server/boot/sample-models.js#L7-L11) (`John`, `Jane`, and
  `Bob`)
- [Creates project 1, sets `John` as the owner, and adds `John` and `Jane` as team
  members](/server/boot/sample-models.js#L14-L29)
- [Creates project 2, sets `Jane` as the owner and solo team
  member](/server/boot/sample-models.js#L33-L48)
- [Creates a role named `admin` and adds a role mapping to make `Bob` an
  `admin`](/server/boot/sample-models.js#L50-L65)

### Configure server-side views

> LoopBack comes preconfigured with EJS out-of-box. This means we can use
> server-side templating by simply setting the proper view engine and a
> directory to store the views.

Create a [`views` directory](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-example-access-control/blob/master/server/views) to store server-side templates.

```
$ mkdir server/views
```

Create [`index.ejs` in the views directory](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-example-access-control/blob/master/server/views/index.ejs).

[Configure `server.js`](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-example-access-control/blob/master/server/server.js#L11-L20) to use server-side
templating. Remember to import the [`path`](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-example-access-control/blob/master/server/server.js#L4) package.

### Add routes

Create [`routes.js`](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-example-access-control/blob/master/server/boot/routes.js). This script does the following:

- Sets the [`GET /` route to render `index.ejs`](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-example-access-control/blob/master/server/views/index.ejs)
- Sets the [`GET /projects` route to render `projects.ejs`](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-example-access-control/blob/master/server/views/projects.ejs)
- Sets the [`POST /projects` route to to render `projects.ejs` when credentials are valid](server/views/projects.ejs) and [renders `index.ejs`](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-example-access-control/blob/master/server/views/index.ejs) when credentials are invalid
- Sets the [`GET /logout` route to log the user out](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-example-access-control/blob/master/server/views/routes.js)

> When you log in sucessfully, `projects.html` is rendered with the authenticated user's access token embedded into each link.

### Create the views

Create the [`views` directory](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-example-access-control/tree/master/server/views) to store views.

In this directory, create [`index.ejs`](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-example-access-control/blob/master/server/views/index.ejs) and [`projects.ejs`](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-example-access-control/blob/master/server/views/projects.ejs).

### Create a role resolver

Create [`role-resolver.js`](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-example-access-control/blob/master/server/boot/role-resolver.js).

> This file checks if the context relates to the project model and if the
> request maps to a user. If these two requirements are not met, the request is
> denied. Otherwise, we check to see if the user is a team member and process
> the request accordingly.

### Create ACL entries

> ACLs are used to restrict access to application REST endpoints.

#### ACL information

- Deny access to all project REST endpoints
  - Select the model to apply the ACL entry to: `(all existing models)`
  - Select the ACL scope: `All methods and properties`
  - Select the access type: `All (match all types)`
  - Select the role: `All users`
  - Select the permission to apply: `Explicitly deny access`
- Allow unrestricted access to `GET /api/projects/listProjects`
  - Select the model to apply the ACL entry to: `project`
  - Select the ACL scope: `A single method`
  - Enter the method name: `listProjects`
  - Select the role: `All users`
  - Select the permission to apply: `Explicitly grant access`
- Only allow admin unrestricted access to `GET /api/projects`
  - Select the model to apply the ACL entry to: `project`
  - Select the ACL scope: `A single method`
  - Enter the method name: `find`
  - Select the role: `other`
  - Enter the role name: `admin`
  - Select the permission to apply: `Explicitly grant access`
- Only allow team members access to `GET /api/projects/:id`
  - Select the model to apply the ACL entry to: `project`
  - Select the ACL scope: `A single method`
  - Enter the method name: `findById`
  - Select the role: `other`
  - Enter the role name: `teamMember`
  - Select the permission to apply: `Explicitly grant access`
- Allow authenticated users to access `POST /api/projects/donate`
  - Select the model to apply the ACL entry to: `project`
  - Select the ACL scope: `A single method`
  - Enter the method name: `donate`
  - Select the role: `Any authenticated user`
  - Select the permission to apply: `Explicitly grant access`
- Allow owners access to `POST /api/projects/withdraw`
  - Select the model to apply the ACL entry to: `project`
  - Select the ACL scope: `A single method`
  - Enter the method name: `withdraw`
  - Select the role: `The user owning the object`
  - Select the permission to apply: `Explicitly grant access`

```
$ lb acl
# follow the prompts, repeat for each ACL listed above
```

### Try the application

Start the server (`node .`) and open [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the app. You will see logins and explanations related to each user type we created:

- Guest `Guest`
  - Role = $everyone, $unauthenticated
  - Has access to the "List projects" function, but none of the others
- John `Project owner`
  - Role = $everyone, $authenticated, teamMember, $owner
  - Can access all functions except "View all projects"
- Jane `Project team member`
  - Role = $everyone, $authenticated, teamMember
  - Can access all functions except "View all projects" and "Withdraw"
- Bob `Administator`
  - Role = $everyone, $authenticated, admin
  - Can access all functions except "Withdraw"
