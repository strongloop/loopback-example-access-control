By default, node-gyp will attempt to compile the module\nlocally and will use that version first before falling back on the pre-built\nbinaries that are included under the compiled/ subdirectory.\n\nCheck builderror.log after install if the module isn't working correctly.\n\nWorks on node 0.8.x and up.\n",
