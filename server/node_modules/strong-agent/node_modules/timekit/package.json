In case of error returns undefined.\n`timekit.cputime()` - uses getrusage and returns cpu time spent on current process (user + system) in microseconds. In case of error returns undefined.\n`timekit.startV8Profiler()` - starts V8 CPU profiler\n`timekit.stopV8Profiler(function(parentNodeUid, nodeUid, totalSamplesCount, functionName, scriptResourceName, lineNumber) {})` - stops V8 CPU profiler. Callback function is called on every node while walking profile's top down call tree.\n\n\n## Platforms\n\nPOSIX and Windows\n\n\n## License\n\nCopyright (c) 2012 Dmitri Melikyan\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
